# IoT Network Profiler

This repository examines how to profile IoT networks based on ICMP statistics. Inital parts of the work are discribed in [Luca's repository](https://github.com/lucamaiano/data-driven-intrusion-detection).

This repository contains two main IPython Notebooks. The first one contains an exploratory analysis that has been conducted in order to better understand and visualize the data. The second notebook contains the *attack detection* experiments that we performed. Results are available in the *data* folder.
